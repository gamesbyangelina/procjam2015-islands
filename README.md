# PROCJAM 2015's Island Sample Project

This is a sample Unity project showing simple island generation using 'cellular automata'. 

## Assets
It uses [Marsh Davies'](https://twitter.com/MarshDavies) 2015 PROCJAM Art Pack, which you can get for FREE at http://www.procjam.com/2015/09/procjam-art-pack-now-available/.

## Controls

Press R to regenerate islands, and the arrow keys to move around. The code isn't super well-documented so this is probably aimed slightly towards people who have worked in Unity before. Hopefully it's useful to someone starting off in procedural generation!
